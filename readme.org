* suragu.net source files
** building
clone this repo in =~/repos/suragu_org= or change the =base-directory=
attribute to wherever this repo is and eval the following snippet
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-publish-project-alist
     '(("suragu.net"
            :base-directory "~/repos/suragu_org/"
            :publishing-directory "~/repos/suragu_org/out_html"
            :section-numbers nil
            :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
            :table-of-contents nil
            :recursive t
            )))

(defun make-suragu ()
     (interactive)
     (org-publish "suragu.net")
#+end_src

and run =M-x make-suragu=. Resulting files will be in
=~/repos/suragu_org/out_html= (or wherever =publishing-directory= is
pointing to.)

You'll also have to use less to generate the .css file from the given
.less file. You can use =lessc=, an online less to css converter, or
whatever you want. Thing is that you have to convert the .less file to
.css.
